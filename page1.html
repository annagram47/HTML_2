    <h1> My Favorite Foods</h1>
        <p> Eating foods is almost something I would consider a hobby for me. It is one 
            of the first things I suggest doing when hanging out with friends. I love exploring 
            new cuisines throughout Seattle and have a list of restaurants that I have been
            working through since I first began college. But below is a list of my top favorite
            foods that will I will never grow tired of. Most of the listed items originate from 
            Asian cultures.</p>
                
    <h1> My Favorite Bands</h1>
        <p> Growing up with older parents meant being exposed to older music. I consider myself 
            lucky for having such a diverse range in the music I enjoy listening to. I never 
            get tired of what I enjoy because I can switch between the genres I like. My favorite 
            bands date back to the 70’s and 80’s and range all the way to current mainstream ones. 
            The genres I like, and which are associated with the list below, vary between indie, 
            new wave, synth-pop, KPOP, and rock.</p>
